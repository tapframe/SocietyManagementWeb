society Management System
       __________________

The Society Management System (SMS) is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to promote social order, awareness, and active community participation in India. The system is structured around two primary user roles: normal citizens and admins, with admins consisting of police officers and advocates who are responsible for enforcing laws and regulations. The platform allows citizens to upload videos or report situations that involve violations of social rules or laws, which are then reviewed by admins for appropriate action. Admins have the authority to accept or reject the proposals submitted by citizens, taking necessary actions such as issuing fines or legal notices, and updating the system to reflect these decisions. Additionally, the system features a section that educates citizens about important laws and rules, ensuring they are aware of their rights and responsibilities. The platform also encourages civic engagement by providing citizens with a space to share ideas aimed at improving the community and fostering societal betterment. Through these integrated features, the Society Management System creates a collaborative and regulated environment where both citizens and authorities can contribute to building a more harmonious society.
